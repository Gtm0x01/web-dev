            <h2>US exits WHO</h2>
            <p>The United States formally completed its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) on January
                22, 2026 — ending its 78‑year membership in the UN health agency.
                The exit was flagged initially by an executive order from President Donald Trump on his first day back
                in office in January 2025, with a one‑year notice period.</p>

                Dollar Rate Riches The Highest
            </h2>
            <p>
                The dollar recently reached new peak levels — Rs 144 + and in some reports above Rs 146 against the
                Nepali rupee.
                This rise increases the cost of imports, fuels inflation on imported goods, and raises expenses for
                foreign debt servicing.
