            <p>The United States formally completed its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) on January
                22, 2026 — ending its 78‑year membership in the UN health agency.<span>
                The exit was flagged initially by an executive order from President Donald Trump on his first day back
                in office in January 2025, with a one‑year notice period.</span></p>

                Dollar Rate Riches The Highest
            </h2>
            <p>
                The dollar recently reached new peak levels — Rs 144 + and in some reports above Rs 146 against the
                Nepali rupee.
                This rise increases the cost of imports, fuels inflation on imported goods, and raises expenses for
                foreign debt servicing.
